          In the Numbers of My Heart

In the whispers of twelve, my journey begins,
A voyage through arithmetic, where love spins.
The ebb and flow of time, in numbers I find,
A mental occupation, soothing my mind.

The thrill of exponents, rules unfurled,
In their intricate dance, a mathematical world.
Excitement blooms, as I discover anew,
In the simplicity of 80/120, a fraction's true hue.

Mathematics, my newfound love, so deep and so pure,
In its structured embrace, I find a cure.
The rhythm of numbers, like music, so sweet,
In the cadence of addition, my heart skips a beat.

Racing past concepts, with nerdish delight,
In the realm of equations, I find my might.
The structure and patterns, in numbers I see,
Mirroring the inner workings of me.

Eleven notes of joy, in structures I find,
Only in mathematics, my mind's not confined.
The constant change, the dynamic flow,
In the abstract realm, my thoughts freely go.

Ten revelations, profound and clear,
Mathematics, my anchor, in life's changing sphere.
Images vivid, structures so bright,
In the depths of numbers, I find my light.

In geometry's embrace, insights galore,
Each problem a key, unlocking a door.
Nine thoughts on learning, with maths as my guide,
Transforming, evolving, with each stride.

Proud of my progress, eight notes of cheer,
In mathematical landscapes, my path is clear.
Connections abound, in every equation,
Linking me to the world, a newfound sensation.

Seven, the number of introspection and thought,
In the challenge of numbers, solace I sought.
In the rhythm of arithmetic, my spirit soars high,
Finding solace beneath the math-laden sky.

Six, the essence of multiplication's charm,
In its patterns and structures, I find no alarm.
The foundation of numbers, so strong and so true,
In their simplicity, my understanding grew.

Five reflections on judgment, growth, and more,
In mathematics' ocean, I eagerly explore.
Combining fields, a joyous endeavor,
In this numeric dance, I'll revel forever.

Four logical structures, in daily life I apply,
In the realm of reason, my thoughts do fly.
Advanced maths beckons, with patterns so grand,
In its intricate webs, I eagerly stand.

Three, the discovery of real-life play,
In the world of numbers, I joyfully stray.
In every fraction, a story untold,
In the dance of digits, my heart grows bold.

Two, the flexibility maths does demand,
In its challenge, I proudly stand.
Courage in numbers, prime and pure,
In their unshakable truth, I find my allure.

One, the final note, my declaration of love,
For mathematics, a gift from above.
In its clarity and structure, my mind finds peace,
In the world of numbers, my joy will never cease.

And so, in the numbers of my heart, I sing,
A melody of maths, in every ring.
For in its embrace, I found my way,
In the world of numbers, forever I'll stay.

In the quiet halls of memory, I pause and reflect,
On the years gone by, the paths I didn't select.
Mathematics, a late blooming flower in my life's garden,
A treasure discovered, yet my heart does harden.

For years I wandered, in ignorance's shade,
Unaware of the numeric wonders, beautifully laid.
In the maze of life, I searched, unknowing,
For the structured harmony, silently growing.

The years slipped by, a river of time,
Unversed in the language, of rhythm and rhyme.
Mathematics, a world hidden, just out of sight,
A universe of numbers, waiting to ignite.

In this melancholic reflection, I find strength anew,
For each day in mathematics, brings a view so true.
In the elegance of equations, my spirit soars free,
In the world of numbers, I find the true me.
